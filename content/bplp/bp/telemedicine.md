Telehealth (also called e-health or mobile-health) is a broader terminology used to describe not just patient and doctor interaction but cases such as doctors exchanging medical information between them, or augmenting capabilities of a clinic by connecting patients to doctors else where.

# Technologies

Telehealth is the use of digital information and communication technologies, such as computers and mobile devices, to access health care services remotely and manage your health care.

* Make health care accessible to people who live in rural or isolated communities.
* Make services more readily available or convenient for people with limited mobility, time or transportation options.
* Provide access to medical specialists.
* Improve communication and coordination of care among members of a health care team and a patient.
* Provide support for self-management of health care.

Technology has the potential to improve the quality of health care and to make it accessible to more people. Telehealth may provide opportunities to make health care more efficient, better coordinated and closer to home.

Research about telehealth is still relatively new, but it's growing. For example, studies have shown that both telephone-based support and telemonitoring of vital signs of people with heart failure reduced the risk of death and hospitalization for heart failure and improved quality of life.

## On-site Kiosks / Patient Portal

Some telehealth providers offer on-site telehealth kiosks that can be placed in a retail clinic, community center, or job site.
Your primary care clinic may have an online patient portal.

Capabilities are..

* Communicate with your doctor or a nurse through computer interface.
* may provide a single point of communication for any specialists you may see.
* More secure than phone / email with pre-configured (convenient / tested) connection.
* Request prescription refills.
* Review test results and summaries of previous visits.
* Schedule appointments or request appointment reminders.
* May equipped with medical monitoring devices (to take vital signs, for example)

## Virtual Appointment

* Enable you to see your doctor or a nurse virtually to receive ongoing care from your regular doctor when an in-person visit isn't required or possible.

## Web-based "Visits"

* These services are generally for minor illnesses, similar to the services available at a drop-in clinic. Some large companies provide access to virtual doctors' offices as a part of their health care offerings. When you log into a web-based service, you are guided through a series of questions. The doctor or nurse practitioner can prescribe medications, suggest home care strategies or recommend additional medical care.
* Similarly, a nursing call center is staffed with nurses who use a question-and-answer format to provide advice for care at home. A nursing call center doesn't diagnose an illness or prescribe medications.
* Websites like WebMD and Mayoclinic have turned the internet into an online medical encyclopedia, a place to get information on health conditions. With a simple wi-fi connection, people can look-up medical symptoms, take a public health course, join an online support chat group, or even chat with a medical professional.

## Remote Monitoring

A variety of technologies enable your doctor or health care team to monitor your health remotely. These technologies include:

* Web-based or mobile apps for uploading information, such as blood glucose readings, to your doctor or health care team
* Devices that measure and wirelessly transmit information, such as blood pressure, blood glucose or lung function
* Wearable devices that automatically record and transmit information, such as heart rate, blood glucose, gait, posture control, tremors, physical activity or sleep patterns
* Home monitoring devices for older people or people with dementia that detect changes in normal activities such as falls

## Doctors talking to doctors

Doctors can also take advantage of technology to provide better care for their patients. One example is a virtual consultation that allows primary care doctors to get input from specialists when they have questions about your diagnosis or treatment.

The primary care doctor sends exam notes, history, test results, X-rays or other images to the specialist to review. The specialist may respond electronically, conduct a virtual appointment with you at your doctor's office, or request a face-to-face meeting.

These virtual consultations may prevent unnecessary in-person referrals to a specialist, reduce wait times for specialist input and eliminate unnecessary travel.

## Personal Health Records (PHR)

An electronic personal health record system — often called a PHR system — is a collection of information about your health that you control and maintain. A PHR app is accessible to you anytime via a web-enabled device, such as your computer, laptop, tablet or smartphone.

In an emergency, a personal health record can quickly give emergency personnel vital information, such as current diagnoses, medications, drug allergies and your doctor's contact information.

## Mobile App

Mobile health apps can be as sophisticated as tracking and reporting a patient’s health information to their healthcare provider, to as simple as providing daily health education tips.

* Store personal health information to track their weight, monitor their sleep patterns, record vital signs, Calculate and track caloric intake. Record physical activity, such as your daily step count.
* see a on-call doctor remotely via 2-way video,
* learn about an illness,
* get tips for preventing infection
* get medication reminder text messages, Schedule reminders for taking medicine.
* stay connected to an online support group

## Telephone

Many healthcare providers use the phone to consult with other specialists on patient cases, discuss medication requirements with a pharmacist, and even provide a diagnosis to a patient in urgent cases (sometimes called teletriage).

## Secure Email

With the recent adoption of patient portals and electronic health records, more healthcare providers and patients are using secure email messaging systems to communicate about lab results and their medical conditions.

## Risks of Telehealth

* could fragment health care and create gasp in care, inappropriate/unnecessary use of medications.
* benefit by limited by patient's ability to pay; insurance reimbursement for telehealth still varies by state and type of insurance.
* care maybe limited because of regional internet availability or cost of mobile devices.

# Considerations for Telemedicine deployment

The most important to consider

* cost
* sustainability
* scalability
* HIPPA-compliance (with existing technologies - not by itself); data encryption, login control, auditing capability.

TM are commonly used for ...

## 1. Remote Monitoring

Patient monitoring/population health management platforms focus on taking periodic, biomedical measurements from the
patients on a tablet, smartphone, or computer web browser, often with the aid of very low cost, basic medical devices like
blood pressure cuffs, thermometers, and digital scales

## 2. Consultative Visits

Consultative visits involve both sides of a conversation being present by video after which an opinion is offered. This type of visit can be divided into teleconsultation in which one clinician consults with another clinician regarding a patient [5] or direct to consumer in which a clinician provides medical advice to a patient.

No diagnostic tools are used during the visit.

Technologies

* Polycom,
* Cisco,
* Vidyo,
* Zoom
* etc..

Most video conferencing services offer business agreements that allow the service to be used in health care where HIPPA is a concern. An advantage of these types of systems is that they can do double duty if your organization needs to use video conferencing for administrative or business purposes in addition to the telemedicine program.

## Direct to consumer (DTC)

Direct to consumer TM is a quickly growing segment of the industry. These platforms offer apps that the patient can download to their smart devices or use on a home PC to schedule and have appointments directly. Many of the platforms also offer the ability to schedule visits.

Companies

* American Well,
* TelaDoc,
* MDLIVE,
* Doctor on Demand.

## 3. Facilitated Visits / Provider Access Software (PAS)

For visits that require a physical exam, it is necessary to use a platform that integrates Medical Devices into the live visit. During a visit that requires a physical exam, it is necessary for a facilitator or clinician to be with the patient to operate the medical devices

These platforms allow integration of class 1 (devices that have a low to moderate risk to the patient and/or user) and sometimes class 2 (devices that have a moderate to high risk to the patient and/or user) medical devices into the live video stream.

These platforms aim to increase access to convenience or frequency of diagnostic, specialty, or follow-up care and to reduce avoidable hospital readmissions.

Due to favorable CMS reimbursement policies regarding the types of places that can serve as “originating sites,” these platforms are most widely used in rural access hospitals, physician offices, federally qualified health centers, schools, corrections institutions, and skilled nursing facilities outside of metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs).

Companies

* AGNES by AMD Telemedicine,
* Intouch Health,
* Avizia telemedicine.

Many allergy practices use TM to perform facilitated virtual visits [9•]. A facilitated virtual visit requires the patient to travel to a medical facility, usually more conveniently located than where the provider is situated, where a healthcare professional assists with the visit.

The site where the patient is located is referred to as the “originating site.”

## Interstate licensing? Does it have emergency declarations?

## Crinitions needed? equipment needed?
