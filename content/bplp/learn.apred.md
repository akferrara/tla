The [APRED project](https://ctil.iu.edu/projects/apred.html) is focused on finding the connections and relationships between disaster risk, resilience, and cost, using a rich data set of documented outcomes for federal disaster recovery efforts. This project, funded by the [Economic Development Administration (EDA)](https://www.eda.gov/disaster-recovery/), will provide an analysis of the outcomes and impacts of FY2012 disaster supplemental appropriation funds spent at the local, county, and state level for disaster relief over a 6-year period, using reporting required under the [Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/performance/goals/gpra).

In this webinar, learn about the [Analysis Platform for Risk, Resilience, and Expenditure (APRED)](https://ctil.iu.edu/projects/apred.html), a brand-new map-based tool for exploring disaster resilience and vulnerability for counties and Economic Development Districts (EDDs) across the United States. Join staff from the [Crisis Technologies Innovation Lab (CTIL)](https://ctil.iu.edu/) and the [Indiana Business Research Center (IBRC)](https://ibrc.kelley.iu.edu/) for a demo and discussion of use cases.
