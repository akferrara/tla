## TLA

The TLA supports:
*	the ability to synthesize real-time data obtained in the field contextualized by additional open-source databases 
*	continuous learning for iteratively improving disaster healthcare
*	an ability to identify lessons learned in the civilian context for dissemination and use in optimizing military healthcare during large scale combat operations (e.g., massive numbers of casualties)

The TLA addresses the gaps in evaluation of technology in disaster environments, research in disaster technologies, and the development of best practices for disaster and battlefield medicine by delivering: 
* an online Total Performance System (TPS) that provides disaster medicine performance measures using a proven approach already being used successfully in military contexts 
* an online Best Practices and Learning Platform (BPLP) that provides broadly accessible insights, best practices, and learning tools for disaster and battlefield medicine based on extensive research capabilities

### Total Performance System (TPS)

* Add link to TPS. We can also host public content from TPS (expose graphs, charts, etc.). 

The online Total Performance System (TPS) provides disaster medicine performance measures using a proven approach already being used successfully in military contexts. 

### Best Practices and Learning Platform (BPLP)

The online Best Practices and Learning Platform (BPLP) provides broadly accessible insights, best practices, and learning tools for disaster and battlefield medicine based on extensive research capabilities.
