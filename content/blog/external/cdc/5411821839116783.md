lead: "There are several things to consider when deciding whether it is safe for you to travel in the United States.  This includes the following: is COVID-19 spreading where you're going, will you be in close contact with others, are you at higher risk of severe illness if you do get COVID-19, do you have a plan for taking time off from work or school, do you live with someone who is older or has a severe chronic health condition, and is COVID-19 spreading where you live?"
